This is an example for the work for the Troop 444 work on Programming Merit badge# Before you start notes## SpyderI prefer to have lines wrap.  Go into Spyder | Python menu | Preference | Editor.  Check "wrap lines"I created a new Spyder project for this (Projects Menu)## Pyton and Ananconda# NotesI used https://www.mapdevelopers.com/geocode_tool.php to determine that the lat/lon coordinates for Farragut Presbyterian Church is (35.884,-84.162).  See https://xkcd.com/2170/ for a comment on lat/lon precision.When doing things incrementally, may need to reload a module.```import impimp_reload(<modulename>)```
